            <h3>Person Retrieval in Video Surveillance (Aug 2022 - Present)</h3>
            <p>Person retrieval in video surveillance using textual queries involves searching for specific individuals based on textual descriptions. By utilizing multi-attribute learning, this approach enables efficient and accurate identification of persons of interest, aiding in forensic investigations and enhancing overall security measures.</p>

            <h3>Sleep Stage Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms (Oct 2021 - Aug 2022)</h3>
            <p>The sleep stage classification project achieved the highest accuracy of 91% in ensemble techniques of multiple models. The features extracted were the biorthogonal wavelet filters. The major impact of this research is to reduce the biasness in the imbalanced dataset. The imbalanced dataset was handled by configuring a new adaptive loss function.</p>

            <h3>Microbial Fuel Cell (Jan 2019 - May 2019)</h3>
            <p>MFC was built as a working prototype of a double-chamber microbial fuel cell using sewage water. MFC gave 3 Volts and 5 mA current.</p>

            <h3>Wind Speed Forecasting with Machine Learning Algorithms (Jul 2018 - May 2019)</h3>
            <p>A model of ARIMA, Support Vector Regression (SVM), and Random Forest algorithms for wind speed forecasting. Of all the models, SVM was the best-performing model with an accuracy of 98%. This forecasting model managed to reduce the penalty of the wind farms by 40%.</p>
